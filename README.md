# RNA-simulation-whitepaper
A Conceptual White Paper by Almer Ajdinovic
Overview
This project outlines an original scientific and philosophical concept:
A suspended sphere of supercritical CO₂ in microgravity is used to host tiny hydrogel droplets filled with RNA-rich water. A central heat source inside the sphere creates a thermal gradient, causing the droplets to drift, orbit, and evolve differently based on their distance from the heat — just like how time and gravity work in space.

🔬 What It Tries to Explore
Can we simulate time dilation and gravitational effects using temperature, fluid motion, and RNA evolution?

What happens when self-replicating molecules exist in separate, isolated "worlds" inside a larger fluid system?

Can this model offer insight into origin-of-life chemistry, consciousness, or even the idea that we might live inside a created or simulated universe?

📄 What's Inside
This repo contains:

A PDF white paper that fully explains the model, its symbolic meaning, and possible scientific value.

Optional diagrams or summaries (coming soon if I expand the project)

🤲 Why I'm Sharing This
I don’t work at a lab. I’m not a physicist.
But I believe that good ideas — especially those that explore existence and awareness — can come from anywhere.

This concept is offered freely to scientists, thinkers, or institutions who might want to explore it, test it, or build upon it.
I ask only for acknowledgment if it ever becomes useful in real research or public conversation.

🧠 Final Thought
If we can build a small universe in a lab — one where heat mimics gravity, and molecules evolve differently based on their position in space —
...what does that say about the universe we live in?
